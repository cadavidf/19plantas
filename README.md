# 19plantas


Do you know how many plants of Cannabis can you grow in your own country? Well, in Colombia the law says you can grow a number not superior to 20 units of plants per person. The way that the law was written makes the professional cannabis growers know for a mathematical fact that if you only grow 19 plants. Just so you are within the bounds of what is allowed. If you want to grow more, you can request a license from the authorities. 

19 Plantas is a statement, a partner that will help you grow cannabis in a way that is private and lawful. 

In my family there have been several diseases which Cannabis seems to solve. Current medical investigations have indicated that it may reverse Pain, Alzheimer and Arthritis among others. We want to help people who want a solution to their medical situation to be able to grow cannabis as a tool to help them live a lifestyle they deserve for a disease they didn't ask for. 

Humans and cannabis are strangely connected. Talking about the endo-canabinoid system (which resides in the homosapiens species) is widely regarded as a taboo subject in many cultures. So we have the power to grow and cultivate a plant that is closely connected to our own system; very similiar to how bees only look for honey. The fact that we as a society have been placing a handbreak on the growth of this plant is like if we had put a stop on bread in the roman empire, or potato during the WWI & WWII. 

We must act now. If you believe in the power of cannabis to help one of your family members or yourself. Make evolution take its course and foster the next generation of human civilization. 

Thanks,
